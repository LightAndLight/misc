# Faster type safe web routing

*2025-07-04*

Sketches a type-safe approach to [`scotty`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/scotty)-style web servers.
In addition to routing web requests, the routing data structure can be used to render a sitemap or API schema.
It can also be used to render type-safe URLs.

I don't remember what this is supposed to be faster than, though.
